>> ABOUT .venv
.venv holds the virtual environment in which Django is installed. Without the .venv file, all
of our Python packages will get installed globally, not just inside of our project.


>> RUNNING THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
If you want to view the project in progress, you can start a development server in VSCode.
Make sure your directory is in "product_showcase" , otherwise the server won't run.

Example (your directory should look something like this):  C:\Users\1014H\Group-Thing-Thing\product_showcase>
